# Decipher
This is Task 2 of Ryan Hansen Assignment 1 which forms part of the  COS 378 Cybersecurity Course

# Descripiton 
 For this task we we given two exercises, involving a ciphered text. With the cipher text, we were, 
 1. Decipher the text into plain text, by solving the key.
 2. Create a mobile android application that takes a photo of ciphered text, and then deciphers it.

# Finding the key
The Word document attached to the repository explains step by step how we solved the cipher. We utilized frequency analysis and our knowledge of the English Language to decipher the text and find the key. 

# Mobile Application  
We use MIT App Inventor to create our mobile application. We imported NMD Ocr, to recognize text in the image. The Orc, however,  doesnt work with cameras that take and store large image files and rather requires a smaller file, generally not larger than 1M. Therefore the application might not function on some devices. We however tested the application on an Android Studio Emulator, emulating a Pixel4 deceive and it was functioning correctly.
