# Decipher
This is Task 2 of Ryan Hansen Assignment 1 that forms part of the  COS 378 Cybersercurity Coure

# Descripiton 
 For this task we we given two exercise, involving a ciphered text. With the cipher text we were, 
 1. Decipher the text into plain text , by solving the key.
 2. Create a mobile android application that takes a photo of ciphered text , then deciphers it.

# Finding the key
The word document attached to the repostory explains step by step how we solved the cipher. We utilized frequency analysis and our knownledge of the English Language to decipher the text and find the key. 

# Mobile Application  
We use MIT App Inventor to create out mobile application. We imported NMD Ocr, to recognise text in the image. The Orc, however  doesnt work with camras that takes and store large image files, and rather require smaller file , generally not larger then 1M. Therefore the application might not function on some device. We howerver tested the applicationon a Android Studio Emulator, emulating a Pixel4 decive and it was functioning correctly.
